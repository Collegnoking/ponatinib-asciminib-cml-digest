**Mini-riassunto (da abstract, estrattivo):**
- Tipo di studio/popolazione: Treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), especially nilotinib and ponatinib, has been associated with atheromatic vascular adverse events including cerebrovascular disease.
- Risultato chiave: Herein, we present two patients with CML and long-term nilotinib treatment, who developed severe carotid atherosclerotic stenoses, both extra- and intracranial, resulting in ischemic stroke.
- Rilevanza clinica: It seems that new-generation TKIs such as nilotinib, ponatinib, and, to a far lesser extent, bosutinib increase the incidence of vascular occlusive events compared to imatinib, in a dose- and duration-dependent manner.
